# CircuitPython
## Hello CircuitPython (Metro and Mu)
### Objective
The objective of this task is to learn about this new programming language called CircuitPython. There is a new board called Metro that looks like the arduino but is different. What your going to try to do is make and LED fade in and out using the new programming language and board.

[I got my code from adafruit and the diagram]https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-digital-inputs-and-outputs/digital-outputs]


### lessons
During this task I learned the basics of the program language Mu. I also learned about how the Metro board works and it's differnces compared to arduino. 


## CircuitPython Servo

### Objective
The objective of this task is to learn how to move a servo 180 degrees clockwise and counter clockwise using a Metro Board Mu as the programming language.

[ I got my picture from my phone because I could not find a diagram for my servo]

### lessons
During this task I learned how to use two wires to control a servo it is called captive touch one wire goes clockwise and the other wire goes counter clockwise.


## CircuitPython LCD
 
### Objective
to get a counter on a LCD to count the amount of presses of a button.Getting the counter placement was hard. after reaching 10, it would keep the 0 or it would move over a space and start printing there. It took some spaces for the LCD to show the the amount of coounts.

### lessons
This assignment helped me better understand For and While loops and their eifficiency and simplicity it also gave me more experience with if statements and how to use them with physical actions such as touching a button. 


## CircuitPython Photointerrupters
Wire up your photointerrupter and have it keep track of how many times it has been interrupted. Your program outputs the count using a sentence which tells you when it got interrupted.

### Objective
Wire up your photointerrupter and have it keep track of how many times it has been interrupted. Your program outputs the count using a sentence which tells you when it got interrupted.

[ I got my picture from images because I could not find a website that had a diagram of a photointterupter]


### lessons
 I learned about time.time and how the lower the variable is the faster it is to notice how many time the phtointeruppter was interupted. I also got to experiment with the commands that detemined how long the code ran for. Just a side note it was really impressive how many times it was able to detect the times it was interrupted.



## CircuitPython Distance Sensor

### Objective
The objective of this task is to get the neopixel to go through a rainbow phases when you move your hand over an ultrasonic sensor. The color changes because of the distance from the ultrasonic.

[I got my picture from searching online and going to images]

### lessons
This was by far the most difficult assignment I have had to complete. The most difficult part was writing the statements that changed the colors based on the distance. I had trouble sorting the variables so they wouldn't overead by each other but have smooth transitions that were clear. This assignment taught me how to further assign and declare variables and also the importance of it.


## CircuitPython RGB LED

### Objective
The objective of this task is to use a class, and module to create a library designed to make working with RGB LEDs easier.

[I got my iamge from online images not from a website]



### lessons

Like the Ultrasonic Sensor, this assignment was more difficult than the rest bringing up new challenges in my code. Like the Sensor, I was going to have to display different colors bringing back up the issue of assigning variables but this time it was different due to the fact I was working with more colors. WHat really got the best of me was the end of the code which was the rainbow section that took me a while to understand.


## Fancy LED


### objective
We have to make the leds do these four methods: alternate, blink, chase, and sparkle.


### Pitctures

### lessons
Like the past 3 assignments, this one was also difficult because it intorduced me to new sequences for LED's. I had trouble with the fact that now I didn't have to make the LED fade but also switch, alternate, flash ect.
