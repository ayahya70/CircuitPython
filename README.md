## Hello CircuitPython (Metro and Mu)
### Objective
The objective of this task is to learn about this new programming language called CircuitPython. There is a new board called Metro that looks like the arduino but is different. What your going to try to do is make and LED fade in and out using the new programming language and board.

## CircuitPython LCD
 
### Objective
to get a counter on a LCD to count the amount of presses of a button.Getting the counter placement was hard. after reaching 10, it would keep the 0 or it would move over a space and start printing there. It took some spaces for the LCD to show the the amount of coounts.
